Files here exist for "emulating" the work of Ledso's Ideapad Battery Limiter (BatteryLimD), since we are dealing with hardware settings.

* 'capacity' refers to: /sys/class/power_supply/<main_battery>/capacity
* 'conservation_mode': /sys/bus/platform/drivers/ideapad_acpi/VPC2004:00/conservation_mode

'capacity'
File content is always an integral number representing battery energy level.
File content example for 99% of battery energy level:
	| 99
	|

Of course, the default file (capacity) is only for reading. We only change the emulated file (batt_level) for testing BatteryLimD.


'conservation_mode'
File content must be 1 or 0, meaning CONSERVATION_MODE_ON and CONSERVATION_MODE_OFF:
CONSERVATION_MODE_ON:	| 1
			|

CONSERVATION_MODE_OFF:	| 0
			|

It can be set via 'echo' command from BASH, for example:
	# echo "1" > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/ideapad_acpi/VPC2004:00/conservation_mode
Or:
	# echo 1 > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/ideapad_acpi/VPC2004:00/conservation_mode

When setting to CONSERVATION_MODE_ON while battery charging above 60%, battery is imediately
